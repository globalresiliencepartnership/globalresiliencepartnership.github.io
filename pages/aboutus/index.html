          <h1>About Us</h1>
          <p>We face a new reality: disasters and shocks are occurring more frequently and chronic stresses are lasting longer. Our future will be defined by three drivers: increasing complexity; where societies and ecosystems become more intertwined, global interconnectivity, and surprise. Stability and assumptions of linear, incremental change are history. Shock and stress â€“ from rapid climate change, growing urbanization, to pandemics and conflict are here to stay. Protracted crises have become the new norm. And the most vulnerable are hit hardest.</p>
