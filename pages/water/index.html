        <h6>WHAT IS THE GLOBAL RESILIENCE WATER WINDOW CHALLENGE? </h6>
        <p>Zurich Insurance Group and the Z Zurich Foundation have partnered with the Global Resilience Partnership to support the Global Resilience Challenge Water Window (Water Window) addressing resilience issues of flood prone communities in the Sahel, the Horn of Africa, and South and Southeast Asia, and building on synergies with the existing work of the Global Resilience Partnership, the Global Resilience Challenge, and the Zurich Flood Resilience Program.
        </p>
        <p>The Global Resilience Challenge is a competitive process intended to bring together multi-disciplinary teams to collaborate with local and regional stakeholders in the diagnosis of resilience problems and opportunities for viable, locally-driven, and high-impact solutions. </p>
        <p>The specific objectives of the Water Window Challenge are:</p>

        <div class="row">

          <div class="small-6 large-6 bluebg columns">

            <h4>to promote water resilience to a range of shocks and stresses by developing and testing novel solutions that address local contexts</h4>

          </div>

          <div class="small-6 large-6 greenbg columns">
            <h4>with dedicated public and private sector funding, to implement and scale the most promising solutions in the Sahel, the Horn of Africa, and South and Southeast Asia</h4>

        <div class="row focus">
          <div class="large-7 columns">
            <h6>WHAT IS THE FOCUS OF THE WATER WINDOW?</h6>
            <p>The Water Window will focus on surfacing new innovative ideas and solutions to help flood prone communities reduce their exposure to flood risks and increase their ability to grow successfully in the face of uncertainty. This moves beyond preparedness for shocks and stresses and towards enhancing resilience that sustain and improve a community’s wellbeing. </p>

            <p>The projects need to fully embrace the concept of flood resilience to shocks and stresses in terms of human, financial, natural, social, and physical capital.</p>
            <p>They should offer solutions to address real issues affecting flood prone communities and ideas that include a focus on one or more of the following programmatic features of the Resilience Partnership: </p>

            <ul>
              <li>Technology</li>
              <li>Innovative financing, including risk transfer mechanisms</li>
              <li>Measurement and diagnostics (e.g., diagnostic tools that provide a platform for data analysis, sharing, and storage)</li>
              <li>Policy and influence</li>
              <li>Learning and innovation (e.g., community practices that enhance awareness, community transformation, education, engagement, female empowerment, and action orientation)</li>
            </ul>
          </div>
          <div class="large-5 columns floodInfo">
            <h2 class="title">Flood Facts</h2>
            <ul>
              <li>Floods cause more damage worldwide than any other type of natural disaster and cause some of the largest economic, social and humanitarian losses </li>
              <li>Over the last 20 years, flooding has affected 2.3 billion people, 95% of whom live in Asia </li>
              <li>During that period, nearly 87% of spending on aid went into emergency response, reconstruction and rehabilitation and only 13% toward reducing and managing risks before they became disasters </li>
              <li>Economic losses from disasters such as earthquakes, tsunamis, cyclones and flooding now amount to an average of US$250 billion to US$300 billion each year </li>
              <li>Flooding alone accounted for 47% of all weather related disasters </li>

Of the five programmatic features of the Global Resilience Partnership (page 3), "self-organization, or adaptive governance" and "natural capital, or infrastructure" is missing - both essential components of a resilient system. Would submissions incorporating these components also be considered?</a>
          <div class="content" id="panel21">
            <p>Yes, applications incorporating any essential component of resilient systems are encouraged. Qualifying applications need to fully embrace the concept of flood resilience to shocks and stresses in terms of human (e.g., labor, health, education, other skills, etc.), financial (e.g., savings, access to credit, etc.), natural (e.g., agriculture, rivers, land, etc.), social (e.g., social support mechanisms, information, etc.), and physical capital (housing, livestock, economic and social infrastructure, production equipment, etc.), to move beyond preparedness.</p>
            <p>However, all submissions should offer solutions that include a focus on one or more of the five programmatic features adopted by the Global Resilience Partnership:</p>
            <ol>
              <li>
                Technology (and Infrastructure) - exploring the intersection of technology and infrastructure, including ‘natural’ infrastructure, natural and man-made disasters, and vulnerable communities;
              </li>
              <li>
                (Markets and) Innovative Financing - use of unconventional financing instruments to mobilize additional private capital for resilience, to optimize the deployment of existing investments, and to increase the sustainability of resilience initiatives;
              </li>
              <li>
                Measurement &amp; Diagnostic – identification and promotion of leading tools and frameworks for measuring resilience; facilitation of the global dialogue on resilience measurement; developing an approach for assessing the economic, environmental, and social impacts of resilience investments; developing tools and techniques to model risk and predict resilience trends; and enhancing the visualization of information for decision makers;
              </li>
              <li>
                Policy &amp; Influence - using insights and evidence to foster political, regulatory, and funding environments that prioritize resilience as an integral component of humanitarian response and development work, and
              </li>
              <li>
                Learning and Innovation (including Convening) - seeking to fill knowledge gaps in cross-cutting areas relevant to resilience (e.g., social capital, entrepreneurship, critical thinking) and in the Resilience Partnership Programmatic Features.

            <p>The Global Resilience Partnership and the Global Resilience Challenge are taking a regional approach, and looking for innovative solutions that will have regional applicability across the Sahel, the Horn of Africa, and South and Southeast Asia. Ideally, these solutions could be relevant globally, too. As such, we have not pre-defined country lists for the three focus regions.</p>
            <p>The Water Window Challenge is unique in that it is looking for teams that can look regionally at resilience challenges, identify those challenges, and then propose solutions.

                <p>Urban: To enhance the flood resilience of urban communities, the project team of ResilNam-Urban will work towards the restoration, conservation and sustainable management of natural retention and drainage areas in Hue City, central Vietnam. These bottom-up nature-based solutions will provide a means to strengthen the role of women in disaster risk reduction and climate change adaptation. Together with local and regional authorities and stakeholders from civil society, ResilNam-Urban seeks to overcome existing gender differences that make women especially vulnerable to the negative impacts of floods.</p>

                <p>The University of Waterloo, Canada, will adapt a model for low-cost amphibious houses, based on those used in flood-prone areas of Louisiana, USA for decades, for the Mekong Delta in Vietnam, considering the local environmental, economic and social context. Data from the project will be used to develop a sustainable business model for replicating the housing design, and support an overall climate change adaptation strategy throughout the region and beyond.</p>
