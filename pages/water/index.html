        <h6>WHAT IS THE GLOBAL RESILIENCE WATER WINDOW CHALLENGE? </h6>
        <p>Zurich Insurance Group and the Z Zurich Foundation have partnered with the Global Resilience Partnership to support the Global Resilience Challenge Water Window (Water Window) addressing resilience issues of flood prone communities in the Sahel, the Horn of Africa, and South and Southeast Asia, and building on synergies with the existing work of the Global Resilience Partnership, the Global Resilience Challenge, and the Zurich Flood Resilience Program.
        </p>
        <p>The Global Resilience Challenge is a competitive process intended to bring together multi-disciplinary teams to collaborate with local and regional stakeholders in the diagnosis of resilience problems and opportunities for viable, locally-driven, and high-impact solutions. </p>
        <p>The specific objectives of the Water Window Challenge are:</p>

        <div class="row">

          <div class="small-6 large-6 bluebg columns">

            <h4>to promote water resilience to a range of shocks and stresses by developing and testing novel solutions that address local contexts</h4>

          </div>

          <div class="small-6 large-6 greenbg columns">
            <h4>with dedicated public and private sector funding, to implement and scale the most promising solutions in the Sahel, the Horn of Africa, and South and Southeast Asia</h4>

        <div class="row focus">
          <div class="large-7 columns">
            <h6>WHAT IS THE FOCUS OF THE WATER WINDOW?</h6>
            <p>The Water Window will focus on surfacing new innovative ideas and solutions to help flood prone communities reduce their exposure to flood risks and increase their ability to grow successfully in the face of uncertainty. This moves beyond preparedness for shocks and stresses and towards enhancing resilience that sustain and improve a community’s wellbeing. </p>

            <p>The projects need to fully embrace the concept of flood resilience to shocks and stresses in terms of human, financial, natural, social, and physical capital.</p>
            <p>They should offer solutions to address real issues affecting flood prone communities and ideas that include a focus on one or more of the following programmatic features of the Resilience Partnership: </p>

            <ul>
              <li>Technology</li>
              <li>Innovative financing, including risk transfer mechanisms</li>
              <li>Measurement and diagnostics (e.g., diagnostic tools that provide a platform for data analysis, sharing, and storage)</li>
              <li>Policy and influence</li>
              <li>Learning and innovation (e.g., community practices that enhance awareness, community transformation, education, engagement, female empowerment, and action orientation)</li>

          <div class="large-5 columns floodInfo">
            <h2 class="title">Flood Facts</h2>
            <ul>
              <li>Floods cause more damage worldwide than any other type of natural disaster and cause some of the largest economic, social and humanitarian losses </li>
              <li>Over the last 20 years, flooding has affected 2.3 billion people, 95% of whom live in Asia </li>
              <li>During that period, nearly 87% of spending on aid went into emergency response, reconstruction and rehabilitation and only 13% toward reducing and managing risks before they became disasters </li>
              <li>Economic losses from disasters such as earthquakes, tsunamis, cyclones and flooding now amount to an average of US$250 billion to US$300 billion each year </li>
              <li>Flooding alone accounted for 47% of all weather related disasters </li>

            <p>Yes, applications incorporating any essential component of resilient systems are encouraged. Qualifying applications need to fully embrace the concept of flood resilience to shocks and stresses in terms of human (e.g., labor, health, education, other skills, etc.), financial (e.g., savings, access to credit, etc.), natural (e.g., agriculture, rivers, land, etc.), social (e.g., social support mechanisms, information, etc.), and physical capital (housing, livestock, economic and social infrastructure, production equipment, etc.), to move beyond preparedness.</p>
            <p>However, all submissions should offer solutions that include a focus on one or more of the five programmatic features adopted by the Global Resilience Partnership:</p>
            <ol>
              <li>
                Technology (and Infrastructure) - exploring the intersection of technology and infrastructure, including ‘natural’ infrastructure, natural and man-made disasters, and vulnerable communities;
              </li>
              <li>
                (Markets and) Innovative Financing - use of unconventional financing instruments to mobilize additional private capital for resilience, to optimize the deployment of existing investments, and to increase the sustainability of resilience initiatives;
              </li>
              <li>
                Measurement &amp; Diagnostic – identification and promotion of leading tools and frameworks for measuring resilience; facilitation of the global dialogue on resilience measurement; developing an approach for assessing the economic, environmental, and social impacts of resilience investments; developing tools and techniques to model risk and predict resilience trends; and enhancing the visualization of information for decision makers;
              </li>
              <li>
                Policy &amp; Influence - using insights and evidence to foster political, regulatory, and funding environments that prioritize resilience as an integral component of humanitarian response and development work, and
              </li>
              <li>
                Learning and Innovation (including Convening) - seeking to fill knowledge gaps in cross-cutting areas relevant to resilience (e.g., social capital, entrepreneurship, critical thinking) and in the Resilience Partnership Programmatic Features.

                <p><strong>Lutheran World Relief’s</strong> project will build the capacity of communities across the Nepal-India border to increase their resilience and their ability to absorb, adapt, and potentially transform in the face of shocks like annual flooding. The solution focuses on the trans-boundary nature of the risk and the need for increased connectedness, communication, and cooperation between Nepal and India. The project will involve collaboration with upstream and downstream stakeholders to foster resilience of affected communities. It will create effective trans-boundary early warning systems, to help build household capacity for disaster risk reduction (DRR) efforts, giving households sufficient time for to prepare and respond. It will also address household adaptive and transformative capacities through strengthening the capacity of farmer cooperatives and self-help groups. <strong>WW-169</strong></p>

                <p><strong>World Vision’s</strong> project in Sri Lanka aims to build flood resilience through innovative social learning, governance, and technical solutions. The project will identify the most promising locations and then use flood modelling and risk assessment technologies, develop a participatory local flood resilience action plan, prioritize potential flood resilience-building interventions and execute them in collaboration with the local communities, institutions and governments to ensure long-term sustainability. The project team will include agronomists and bankers, alongside government, agribusiness, ecological and finance experts. <strong>WW-085</strong></p>

                <p><strong>Mercy Corps</strong> provides an information-based model for trans-boundary collaboration and investment in Indonesia to create flood resilience across watersheds. Its intervention takes an integrated approach to flood risk reduction including the introduction of cutting-edge, user-friendly, information tools for communities, government, and private sector organisations. The tools provide actionable, real-time information on flood risks and projected returns on investment from flood risk-reducing measures, strengthening structures for collaboration and coordinated action for flood risk reduction. Working with government, community and private sector stakeholders in vulnerable downstream urban neighbourhoods and upstream rural villages, Mercy Corps will provide a range of risk reducing measures across the Basin. <strong>WW-057</strong></p>

                <p><strong>Catholic Relief Services’</strong> proposal identifies three barriers to building resilience in metro Manila: generic top-down development plans, rampant urban redevelopment and poorly maintained flood control infrastructure. Its aim is to develop a manual for resilient urban redevelopment through capacitating city officials and working with the population to develop best practices. Once this has been completed, investment will be made in priority planning projects which ensure flood resilience is at the heart of these proposals. The manual will provide city officials with the knowledge and tools required to replicate urban development for resilience and implement new urban development plans for priority sites. <strong>WW-109</strong></p>

                <p><strong>Seacology</strong> will help the most marginalized and poorest members of the community – such as widows from the civil war, and youth belonging to low income or widow-headed households – by providing small loans. Based in Sri Lanka, the project will also offer training to start new businesses or small scale farming activities, along with financial literacy and budgeting classes. This provides them with an alternative income source, thus deterring them from cutting down mangroves for firewood. In return for the loans, project participants are also expected to guard the mangrove forests near their home. All of this is to boost livelihoods, food security and reduce the risk of storm surges and tsunamis. <strong>WW-098</strong></p>
