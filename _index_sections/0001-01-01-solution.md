## The Global Resilience Partnership aims to help millions of vulnerable people in the Sahel, the Horn of Africa, and South and Southeast Asia better adapt to shocks and chronic stresses and invest in a more resilient future. With an initial commitment of $150 million, this new Resilience Partnership will help the global community pivot from being reactive in the wake of disaster to driving evidence-based investments that enable cities, communities, and households to better manage and adapt to inevitable shocks. 

- Together we will
- Identify critical capacity gaps
- Catalyze alliances across all sectors
- Enable regional and global learning
- Advance data-driven analytics and measurements
- Design flexible financial mechanisms, such as micro-finance and risk insurance

## We will strive to improve resilience at multiple scales: from families to communities, countries to regions.
