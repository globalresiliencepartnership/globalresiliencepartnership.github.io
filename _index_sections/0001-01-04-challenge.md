# Global Resilience Challenge

## Resilience Challenges are a key feature of the Global Resilience Partnership, focused on bringing together people and organizations from across sectors to collaborate on innovative and transformative solutions to the toughest resilience challenges in the three focus regions: the Horn of Africa, the Sahel, and South and Southeast Asia. Multi-sectoral teams will collectively develop locally driven, high-impact solutions that can build resilience at scale.
