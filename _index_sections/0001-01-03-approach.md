	<h2>A new reality needs a new solution</h2>
	<p>We can no longer afford business as usual. The number of reported disasters has nearly tripled since 1980, and the cost of those disasters is up 300%, to US$ 200 billion every year. In 2015, OECD nations spent US$ 13.6billion on humanitarian aid, a rise of 11% from 2014. Over the last 30 years, one-third of development spending – US$ 3.8 trillion – went on recurrent costs.</p>

	<p>The current aid and development approach, whilst it has had its success stories, is not working optimally. It is hugely weighted – in terms of funding and human resources – towards emergency and humanitarian response.</p>

	<p>What if, rather than focusing on repair, we built resilience?</p>
