Better measurement and tracking of resilience are key to ensuring that investments in resilience building are supporting the right activities and targeting the right people. Despite growing interest in enhancing resilience in the Horn of Africa and elsewhere, efforts for tracking resilience have yielded little success. Much of this owes to: different understandings and interpretations of ‘resilience’; the top-down and expert-driven nature of resilience measurement and indicator selection; and poor availability of robust socio-economic datasets. 

This team seeks to develop methods for the collection of bottom-up information related to people’s resilience, and feed this into improved policy and programming. Alongside this, it aims to leverage the unique opportunities that ICTs provide in collecting valuable high frequency data relating to various components of resilience at considerable scale. These new sources of information and perspectives could be used to support new forms of targeted direct financing for resilience, rapid assessment of disaster response and rehabilitation, and more effective monitoring of resilience-building initiatives.
