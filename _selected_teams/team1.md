Cities concurrently contain barriers and hold the seeds for building resilience. Traditional project-based interventions do not build enough on local capacities and are not transformational. Strengthening resilience requires approaches that engage communities to build, access, and utilize their own information resources to shift collective decision-making toward resilient outcomes, at both household and community levels. Solutions created by local change agents are much more likely to be inclusive, adaptive, and self-organizing – capitalizing on innovative ways of communicating, connecting, and acting. The Team will use a series of linked analysis and design activities to explore new ways to use information to assess risks and expand the adaptive strategies of urban slum communities through the following steps:

1. Improving access to risk information on the part of the most vulnerable to better diagnose local barriers to resilience themselves. The Team will leverage the Red Cross’ involvement in the Missing Maps project to explore solutions for engaging community teams in crowdsourcing community infrastructure, vulnerability, and other resilience data (including political, economic, social, and cultural drivers of risk). Gathering existing and new data and mapping it in an open, non-proprietary platform will engage wide audiences, including community members, civil society organizations, and city authorities. The Team will plan for transparency and coordination using Ushahidi’s online tools to report geocoded activities, adhering to International Aid Transparency Initiative standards and reporting at granular levels through the Foreign Assistance Dashboard, and using the USAID privacy policy and Open Data Privacy Analysis Template as guidance.

2. Enhancing collective decision-making for local resilience solutions based on risk information. The Team will use a local ‘open design’ challenge to engage communities in designing resilience solutions that leverage risk information in innovative ways to inform:

* DIY approaches that individuals and communities can self-organize and self-resource
* creative resourcing to draw out hidden capacities, e.g. through local coalitions
* advocacy and incentives for adoption, e.g. using minimum standards for resilience to guide decision-making
* systems-based approaches that draw on and protect environmental and social goods and services
* emerging technologies to reduce barriers to entry

In addition to the solutions identified, the local design process itself will be a replicable product. Cross-learning and peer-sharing to increase networking and drive wider scaling. The leverage points identified for local solutions in the open design process will also provide insight into key elements needed to foster agency and self-organization on resilience that can be promoted for cross-learning and peer-sharing between communities and enable wider opt-in and scaling.
