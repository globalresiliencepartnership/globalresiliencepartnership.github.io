The proposed Team will focus on addressing barriers to effective governance and collective decision-making in urban slums. 

The Team will look to leverage innovation in mobile and data tools to connect with and galvanize urban slum communities to identify critical capacity gaps and uncover hidden coping strategies and resilience capacity that can be supported and scaled. By increasing the flow of risk information to and from communities, the anticipated solutions will motivate collaboration among stakeholders on data that define their resilience, their challenges, and their solutions.
