The wetlands in the Mekong River Basin directly support the livelihoods and safety of millions and indirectly serve as a natural barrier to disasters for tens of millions of people across four Southeast Asian nations. International organizations, national governments and local communities all recognize the negative impacts of climate change on the wetlands, but lack appropriate tools for integrated planning and coordination across sectors;  effective communication between scientists, local people and decision-makers; as well as knowledge and understanding of different options for resilience interventions . This team’s key impact – using the diverse team influencers to develop new planning tools and a portfolio of  site and gender specific resilience actions while helping to drive collaboration on developing integrated Water and Land Use Plans for Ramsar wetlands and their surrounding landscapes and then replicating best practices at the regional level – recognizes that resilience building is filled with positive externalities. By improving and adapting land and water  use in each wetland, the dividends  are magnified both down and upstream.
