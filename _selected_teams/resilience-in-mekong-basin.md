The wetlands in the Mekong River Delta directly affect the livelihoods and safety of thousands and indirectly serve as a natural barrier to disasters for millions of people across four Southeast Asian nations. International organizations, national governments and local communities all recognize the negative impacts of climate change on the wetlands, but lack coordination and communication. This team’s key impact – using the diverse team influencers to drive collaboration on developing Land Use Plans for individual villages and then replicating best practices at the regional level – recognizes that resilience building is filled with positive externalities. By improving and adapting land use in one key region of the wetlands, the dividends both down and upstream are magnified.
