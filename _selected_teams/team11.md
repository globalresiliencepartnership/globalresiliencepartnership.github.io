The team will apply a systems approach to understanding the link between inclusive financial services and more resilient livelihoods. A research model based on an iterative process will increase understanding of the potential impact of financial safety nets (FSN) to protect livelihoods for transhumant households and make concrete gains towards food security and resilience during shocks for agro-pastoralists. Preserving core productive assets and livelihood strategies at times of seasonal climatic shocks through access to tailored, demand-driven FSNs may help vulnerable households absorb shocks and rebound more quickly, while unlocking new opportunities for income generation and growth. First, we seek to understand the current modes of coping and adaptation and then will engage communities and private sector partners to envision what FSN could augment these existing strategies. The following outlines the three phases:

1. The 1.5 month Problem Statement Development phase will develop indicators of resilience to use as a baseline to characterize and evaluate potential impacts of social, ecological, and economic conditions and pressures related to financial inclusion.

2. The 3.5-month Solution Development Phase will be based on results from the three research outputs. We will refine our hypothesis and develop a framework to test solution prototypes in an iterative process: 1) analysis with communities, 2) GRP team deliberations, 3) participatory solution-testing, and 4) feedback and iteration of solutions.

3. In the Implementation Phase, we will examine solutions for resilience in the face of future shocks and stresses and test resilience indicators in 3,000 households, including women-led households. Solutions will be applied and scaled in two Sahelian regions. We will share our experiences with financial services providers, checking the impact of solutions through a broad-based assessment. We will engage communities in market development activities, using cell phones to share market information to build disaster risk management. We will identify long-term solutions to environmental degradation and implement at least five low-cost FSN livelihood enhancement activities to build resilience.
