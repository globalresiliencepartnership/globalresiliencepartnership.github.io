Examining the challenges that people with disabilities (PWDs) face in responding to disasters and risk inSouth East (SE) Asia and identifying solutions for mainstreaming disability-inclusive disaster risk reduction planning and action (DiDRR). Emphasis will be placed on exploring the role that context and culture play in (i) reinforcing current barriers to resilience and (ii) creating platforms for empowerment, inclusion and positive transformation.

PWDs are four times more likely to die when a disaster strikes than those withoutdisabilities and six per cent of all disaster-affected people acquire physical, cognitive or psychological disabilityfrom the event. PWD vulnerabilities are heightened by: routine exclusion from disaster risk reduction (DRR) and emergency management planning processes; low levels of risk awareness including riskwarnings (information is often presented in inappropriate and inaccessible formats); inaccessibility to evacuationfacilities and emergency provisions; emergency response service providers and staff being unaware of the specialneeds of PWDs and ill-equipped and under-resourced; and the interruption or removal of important socialnetwork and support systems.PWD vulnerability levels in SE Asia to disasters are high due to: poverty; poor education levels andcommunication skills; gender inequality; cultural norms and beliefs that perpetuate negative stereotyping and discriminatory attitudes and behaviour; and limited institutional understanding and support. Consequently,PWDs in the region remain largely unseen, unheard and uncounted.

Objectives are to: (1) Identify the challenges that PWDs face in responding to disasters in SE Asia; (2) Explore how contextual, cultural and institutional conditionsin different community and cultural contexts influence the vulnerability and resilience of PWDs to risk; (3) Identifyresilience-building solutions that improve inclusivity, promote active participation and empowerment of PWDs in DiDRR, and identify best ways to foster and support cooperation between institutional DRR actors and PWDs.
