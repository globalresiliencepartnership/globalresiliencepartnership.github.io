Millions of dollars are spent every year on costly cement coastal barriers that fail to provide long-term disaster protection and further harm damaged ecosystems. This team’s key resilience innovation is to restore nature-based defenses – mangrove forests and coastal reefs – as a means of reducing at-risk populations’ climate and social vulnerabilities in a sustainable and cost-effective way. 

Armed with years of experience restoring mangrove forests and coral reefs throughout Southeast Asia, the team will develop best practices and guidance for future initiatives and expand access to an innovative ecological mapping project, [Science for Nature and People (SNAP)](http://www.snap.is/groups/coastal-defenses/). While mangrove and coastal restoration are not new ideas to the region, these projects often lack the coordination and long-term planning that Geographic Information System (GIS) mapping tools and community-managed programs could provide. This team’s goal is to explore the best ways to achieve both ecological conservation and risk-reduction in a way that builds critical resilience for over 200 million people in at-risk coastal regions around the world.
