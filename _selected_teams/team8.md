The projectâ€™s aim to address the disconnect between policy and best practices in sustainable management of wetlands by enhancing adaptation capacities in the 11 Mekong Ramsar sites in Thailand, Cambodia, Vietnam and Lao PDR. This will be achieved through the development and implementation of multi-disciplinary and collaborative local planning including land use planning and adaptation plans, which will consider both the government and the communities in the regions. It will also identify indicators and design appropriate guidelines to monitor resilience throughout the region following a multi-disciplinary systems perspective. The project has 3 main components as follows:

1. Building a bridge between science and local knowledge by incorporating the knowledge of the local communities into the scientific climate change projections and communicating this knowledge back to the communities in a way that they will understand. The project will also support the development of a vulnerability assessment for the sites based on existing methodologies.

2. Collaboratively develop Land Use Plans (LUPs) and commune/ village development plans that will support adaptation and resilience. This process will involve both communities and governments and building on the knowledge from component (i) above, develop LUPs that will support the development of climate change resilient village adaptation plans. This will use a combination of workshops, field visits and study tours as well as concrete mapping exercises.

3. Disseminate the information at a regional level to support a coordinated approach to climate change resilience in Mekong wetlands and improve existing policies, guidelines and tools. The project will facilitate various forums for sharing knowledge and lessons learnt by the local communities and the governance bodies. Regional high level forums will also be developed to share the lessons learnt with national Ramsar authorities and integrate project outcomes into regional and national polices and plans. Through this participative sharing process, it is expected that the project will support innovative governance mechanism and improve knowledge sharing mechanism on climate change resilience for the Mekong wetlands and support the revision of existing regional and international guidelines, tools, strategies and policies on wetlands management and resilience.
