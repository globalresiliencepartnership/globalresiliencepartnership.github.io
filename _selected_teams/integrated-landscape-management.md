Land and water resources in the arid and semi-arid parts of the Horn of Africa have come increasingly under pressure as a result of climate change, population growth, and natural resource-based economic development. 

This team will seek to improve landscape planning, governance and investment, and strategically link and scale up existing innovations, both ‘quick wins’ and longer-term investments. A series of landscape leader workshops, strategic mapping analyses and key informant interviews will help identify solutions for inherently connected challenges in the field of land, water, energy and biodiversity.
