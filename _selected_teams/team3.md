The objective is to use gaming to engage and excite students so they can better understand the role they play in Disaster Risk Reduction (DRR) and climate change resilience through an entertaining game with serious content available on the tool they know best - the mobile phone. They propose to use free, readily accessible, entertaining and interactive electronic games as an active-learning platform to target male and female Asian university students, youth and gamers (ages 18-30) to:

- Help them visualize the complexity of problem solving through self-directed exploration to solve common resilience challenges, survive in different future scenarios or states of climate uncertainty, and require them to make decisions to protect communities, cities, or countries from floods, tidal surges, typhoons and other climatic shocks.
- Provide them with instant feedback on their in-game choices to promote resilience. Games create a compelling need to learn, assimilate and master certain skills and content areas. Failure leads to improved solutions. Students can learn new material through a game â€“ allowing them to demonstrate increased understanding, better retention, and higher quality learning outcomes than students who learn the same material through traditional studies.
- Help them understand the multi-sectoral challenges policy makers and private sector leaders face, such as whether to invest public funds in building a more climate resilient infrastructure, securing health care systems, shock-proofing businesses, strengthening social safety nets, establishing environmental safeguards for potable water and so on.
- Help move them to become more active members of society, change personal behaviors, and connect with like-minded individuals' intent on advocating for social change and action.
- Connect with other students and youth from across the South and Southeast Asia to identify common solutions and how they can integrate "resilience thinking" into their future career pursuits or professions.

This project will take place in: South and Southeast Asia.To promote resilience, the project aims at creating multidisciplinary, disruptive response that helps individuals form opinions on how personal and public decisions should be made to minimize conflict about which populations and assets will be protected, and what measures must be taken to help governments, businesses and families withstand an array of climatic shocks and stresses.

To widen the impact of the project the Lead organisation will partner with institutions from across Asia, which include five regional universities, DRR specialists, NGOs and game developers. This multidisciplinary group will convene a wide variety of other stakeholders to collaboratively further define the problem and how a youth-focused game might address it, determine the structure and content of the game, and develop a plan for game distribution.
