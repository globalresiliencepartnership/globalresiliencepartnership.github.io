Making systematic use of the as yet untapped hydrological potential of roads is an innovative approach, which can contribute to climate resilience, water buffering, and reduced risks than dedicated special investments. Integrating the hydrological function of roads in the design process in the Horn of Africa will facilitate around 20 million rural dwellers to become more climate resilient with different socio-economic interaction and technical designs in different areas â€“ depending on livelihood systems and geographical conditions. With the large chance for up-scaling this offers, climate resilience will come in a variety of ways, including, but not limited to: (i) an increased percentage of harvestable water; (ii) an increased fraction of run-off water that can be directed to groundwater recharge zones; (iii) a reduced rate of soil erosion, preventing loss of fertile top soil; (iv) stabilized micro-climate by virtue of the assured moisture in the landscape and reduced gullying; and (v) organized activities such as commercial sand harvesting.

This project will take place in representative areas: Tigray, Amhara, & Oromia region (Ethiopia) and Tana Basin (Kenya). It will analyze how road side communities can be critically involved in the planning of climate resilient roads and water harvesting opportunities, including a review of the distributional impact of damage and benefits; how stakeholders can improve cooperation and integrate resilient road planning and design criteria and solutions that build resilience to droughts, dry spells, and floods by optimizing water storage and groundwater recharge and retention from rural road development, and what type of specific designs are appropriate to areas that differ in livelihood systems and geographical conditions.

To widen the impact of the project the consortium will:

- Develop national/district partnerships with research organizations; road authorities; agriculture, rural development, and water resources bureaus; local communities reviewing case studies with the help of the multi-disciplinary team.
- Build on existing contacts, engage international networks, conferences and for a including key funders/co-investors of rural road investment like the Safety Net Programs, International Development Banks, and national Road Funds, as well as IGAD
