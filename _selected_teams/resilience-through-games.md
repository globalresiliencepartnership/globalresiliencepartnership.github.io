How can we use gaming as a way to capture the attention of youth and focus them on issues such as disaster risk reduction, climate change, and resiliency? In Southeast Asia alone, there are expected to be 130 million gamers by 2017. By creating a free, accessible, entertaining and interactive game similar to Angry Birds and Minecraft, the FHI 360 team plans to introduce players to the concept of resilience by exploring the complexities of human impact on our environments.  The game will allow users to envision how personal actions and societal investments in disaster risk reduction can have long-term positive effects on such things as the quality of life, local economies, and public health and safety, among others. By playing the game, it is hoped that users will become more informed citizens, motivated to act, and connect with like-minded individuals to identify common solutions.
