The Project will address the drivers of vulnerability and promote resiliency among SHF. The team is employing a multi-sectoral approach that brings together public and private actors across agriculture, financial services, and other sectors to deliver integrated solutions that enable farmers to anticipate, manage, and mitigate complex risks. The approach focuses on empowering SHFs by combining access to relevant, timely and information and financial services through tailored mobile solutions and networks of trusted rural agents known as Community Knowledge Workers ("CKWs"). Their human-centered mobile solutions are designed to help strengthen CKW networks that reach the last mile, build dynamic, two-way channels to share data, and help catalyze behavior change that leads to increased SHF resiliency. The project also leverages expertise from value chain actors, agronomists, technical assistance experts, climate change specialists and a leading global data analytics firm to enable SHFs to better manage risks and increase household resilience. The project objective will focus on not only improving the household resiliency of the poorest coconut and cocoa SHFs in the Philippines and Indonesia, but will also strengthen their environmental resiliency to adapt and respond to climate change and external shocks. Overall, it aims to address the following areas: a) improved productivity; b) income diversification; c) Improved Access to Crop Insurance, Household Insurance, and Agriculture Financial Services and d) Early Warning Systems.

The project will pilot and amend solutions during year one with 1,800 coconut farmers in Southern Luzon and 10,000 cacao farmers in Mindanao, Philippines. Following the pilot phase, proven innovative solutions will be scaled nationally to coconut farming communities in Palawan, Cebu, and other locations in the Philippines, where intercropping of cacao on 100,000 coconut farms will rollout during year two. At the same time, the Team will expand proven solutions and customize for coconut and cacao farmers in Indonesia.
