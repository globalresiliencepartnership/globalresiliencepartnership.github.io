In addition to bringing to bear the most current physical science regarding flood vulnerability and net sea-level rise, this project will draw on the NASA SERVIR project, which is building a regionally integrated flood early warning system. It draws on community development expertise and methods that have been successfully applied to boost climate resilience in N. and L. America. This project will partner with Institute for Water Modelling (IWM), Institute of Water & Flood Management (BUET) and the Institute of Disaster Management & Vulnerability Studies (U. Dhaka). In terms of concrete objectives, it will:

- develop a model of community participation that integrates local water management, flood early warning and people-centric disaster assistance, including micro-finance and development assistance with national water and economic planning;
- create a GBW-wide flood early warning system that takes into account the local risks confronted by particular communities, integrating both regional and highly localized information and tracing both physical and human events on a near-real time basis;
- improve the quality of risk indices and an inventory of adaptation initiatives so that better medium- and long-run information about land subsidence, sea-level rise and flooding can be incorporated into infrastructure and other long-term solutions and collective learning from past initiatives is developed;
- develop regional and local adaptive capacity with an interdisciplinary knowledge team that can use a range of physical, social and policy science tools to inform decision-making at multiple levels;
- integrate adaptation planning and initiatives across institutional sectors (private, public, NGOs IGOs, academics) and different scales (national, sub-regions, villages, households).

The project leverages and expands the Belmont/IGFA BanDAID Project which partners The Ohio State University and the Institute for Water Modelling. It expands the team by bringing in the two afore-mentioned leading institutes in water management and disasters, the Blue-Gold Project, community NGOs affiliated with these institutes, the major government agencies involved in national planning, water management, flood early warning and disaster assistance, and experts in different regions and aspects of hydrology, remote sensing, disaster early warning, and development assistance. It will create a multi-sectoral and interdisciplinary coordinating board to design the subsequent stages of the CCAD project and usestate-of-the-art IT methods to coordinate our team efforts. Once developed, this CCAD can serve as a model for parallel initiatives in non-coastal Bangladesh and other heavily populated deltas throughout Asia and SE Asia.
