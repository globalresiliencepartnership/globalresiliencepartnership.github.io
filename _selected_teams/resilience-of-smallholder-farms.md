Thirty-two percent of the population in the Philippines and 40 percent in Indonesia are directly employed in agriculture, particularly in rural areas. The teamâ€™s key resilience innovation is to ensure that smallholder farmers have access to information to help increase productivity and to help improve agricultural practices to become more sustainable and resilient.

By providing mobile-based information on real-time weather feeds, historic climate trends, and pest and disease outbreaks, farmers can improve both productivity and their income. The team will also provide farmers with financial information on crop insurance, household insurance, and agricultural financial services. This will enable farmers to stabilize their income and achieve more resilient livelihoods.  The team plans to launch their project in the Philippines with 1,800 coconut farmers in Southern Luzon and 10,000 cacao farmers in Mindanao, eventually working to scale out the project nationally.
