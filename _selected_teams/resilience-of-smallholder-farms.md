Grameen Foundation will build resilience among coconut farmers in the Philippines who, despite forming the backbone of the countryâ€™s top agricultural industry, are chronically poor and especially vulnerable to climate change. The team will help farmers to improve productivity, access financial services, expand market access, and use early warning systems to control pest and disease outbreaks. Working with government, agribusiness, and financial services partners, the team will leverage mobile technology to provide coconut farmers with real-time data and services to help strengthen their businesses and reduce losses to their families due to extreme weather events and volatile markets.
