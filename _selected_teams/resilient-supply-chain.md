Supply chain factories are often the central source of livelihoods in urban South and Southeast Asian communities, but they also are often the infrastructure most at-risk to natural disasters and can have serious environmental risks. This team’s key innovation is recognizing business leaders as important stakeholders in contributing to building urban resilience and turning factory managers into champions of economic, environmental and community resilience. The initiative aims to leverage corporate partnerships with Mahindra & Mahindra, Walmart and GE to expand a network of “Environment, Health and Safety” Centers that feature trainings that emphasize a holistic, management systems approach and underscore the business case for investing in sustainable and equitable manufacturing.
