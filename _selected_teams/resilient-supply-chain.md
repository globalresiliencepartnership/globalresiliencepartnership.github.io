Supply chain factories are often the central source of livelihoods in urban South and Southeast Asian communities, but they and the communities surrounding them share serious vulnerabilities to climate disruption and environmental risks. This team’s key innovation is recognizing business leaders as important stakeholders in contributing to building urban resilience and developing factory managers into champions of economic, environmental and community resilience. The initiative aims to work with private sector partners to explore the ways that Institute for Sustainable Communities’ Environment, Health and Safety Network can be leveraged to provide resilience training, while creating stronger connections to help factories and communities build the skills they need to be more resilient.
