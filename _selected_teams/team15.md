Trans-African Hydro-Meteorological Observatory is proposing to create and innovative Early Warning System (EWS) that provides key components of the critical weather observing and forecasting infrastructure needed, particularly in the Horn of Africa region. Their approach to this system will enable effective monitoring and alerting at a fraction of the cost and technical investment required for traditional systems.

Consultations and pilots show that real-time Automated Weather Systems (AWS) networks that include remote-sensing, total lightning sensors installed on existing mobile telecommunication infrastructure, offer national-scale, radar-like data and information that is currently unavailable due to costly procurement, installation, and operation.

The concept is to collaboratively design and implement an end-to-end meteorological monitoring and prediction infrastructure that is cost-effective, durable, and that uses real-time networks.The proposed EWS is scalable and can be made available in any part of the Horn of Africa, providing real-time resolution and maximum reliability to observe, inform, and alert the public and government agencies to impending climate-induced hazards.

Critically, such in-situ, surface observation network data is best fed into cloud-computing based now casting and numerical weather prediction systems as well as tailored applications for food security, aviation safety, flood warnings, drought monitoring, and public safety alerting. Finally, capacity development will be performed through the preliminary and ongoing training of field engineering technicians, agro-meteorologists and EWS end users.

Their sustainability plan is focused on design and implementation of products and services for the private sector using information from the EWS. The business model to deploy and support the EWS has several components to ensure it is a sustainable including shared initial investment with seed funding, shared operational responsibilities and data rights, shared revenue from ongoing data services to target market customers, and appropriate funding allocated to ensure reliable network operation.
