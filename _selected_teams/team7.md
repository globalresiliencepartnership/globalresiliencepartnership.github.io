The project aims to make resilience a regular part of doing business by creating a network in the business sector to drive action on urban and supply chain resilience. Specifically, the project aims at: 1) creating a more disaster resilient supply chain benefiting business continuity, profitability and sustainability; 2) increased safety and resilience of the workforce to environmental hazards; and 3) enhanced socio-economic and environmental resilience of the surrounding urban communities.

The project will initially target factories in Bangladesh, India and Thailand, with interest in later incorporating Indonesia and the Philippines and countries in the Greater Mekong Region.

Specific objectives of the project include: making the business case for why factories, supply chains, brands and communities need to invest in and work together to advance resilience; developing a resilience curriculum with community input for factory managers, including adaptive leadership; and developing at least three case studies from representative factories helping to illuminate the factors and conditions necessary for building resilience, and disseminating the results.

The consortium will achieve these objectives by:

- Making resilience fully embedded in professional certifications and degree programs at universities; and
- Using the training model to help city leaders and planners with tools and know how to prioritize resilience Investments

The consortium will train factory managers and other stakeholders on how to better anticipate, act and learn to build resilience of their business and workforce to a range of environmental hazards, as well as identifying inter-linkages between factory operations and local economic and social activities.
