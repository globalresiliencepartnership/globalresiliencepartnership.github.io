In each of these regions, the Resilience Team will promote context-specific multi-actor processes, to strengthen the adaptive capacity of small scale farming households living in ecologically fragile and risk prone areas, to reduce their vulnerability to food insecurity, adapt to climate change, develop more resilient and sustainable livelihoods, and co-develop- in coordination with local government- improved strategies for disaster risk reduction (DRR) and early warning, using gender and nutrition sensitive approaches, and take these to scale.

The Resilience Team will address these priorities: a) harness agriculture to be more productive, diverse, resilient and sustainable through agroecology b) integrate DRR and Community based Adaptation (CBA) to climate change with diversifiedLivelihood promotion c) strengthen the equity, gender and nutrition sensitivity of the Livelihood promotion and DRR/CBA dimensions of resilience d) strengthen the capacity of local governments in each context to better plan and coordinate multi-actor processes for resilience, and identify, adapt and scale local best practices. The overarching goal is to develop a "proof of concept" of an effective collaborative, integrated approach to strengthening resilience of resource-poor farmers (and especially women) living in ecologically fragile and risk prone dry lands in three national contexts. These experiences, once systematized and documented, will serve as the basis for leveraging widespread scaling, within those countries, and more widely across the Sahel. This approach includes: a) Collaboration Platforms: b) Resilient Livelihoods c) Local Scaling.

The first dimension of collaboration will be strategy development and process design within and by the team themselves, using the insights of the disciplines and experience of each (i.e., local governance, nutrition, gender, NRM, DRR, CBA, agroecology, multi-stakeholder social learning, strengthening local capacity). They will consult through Skype conferences and email to develop a detailed approach, identify support needs for implementation in each country, and agree on the modalities of team work and management. Secondly, they will promote multi-actor collaboration in each region by jointly facilitating a multi-disciplinary and participatory approach to problem identification, finding solutions, and designing integrated resilience initiatives.
