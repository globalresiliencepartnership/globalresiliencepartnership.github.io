Most farmers in the Sahel also rely on livestock, and this livelihood is increasingly at risk of a dangerous convergence of chronic drought, political instability, and erratic weather. Many families, particularly those led by women, lack basic access to financial services and savings mechanisms that would empower them to become more resilient to these persistent shocks. This teamâ€™s key innovation is to deeply understand the demand for micro-credit, insurance and savings mechanisms, as well as cash transfers through state-led social safety nets, in order to communicate these demands to private sector and public actors. By doing so, the team will identify critical barriers and previously unknown market demands for financial services that would help families build resilience to future urgent shocks and persistent stresses.
