MercyCorps will strengthen the resilience of agro-pastoralists in Mali and Niger, by expanding their access to formal financial services. The project will educate agro-pastoralist men and women so that they can make informed decisions about their household finances and better manage risk. It will unlock access to new credit options, including warehouse credit for farmers and tailored credit products for womenâ€™s groups. Using mobile banking and other technologies, 50,000 agro-pastoralists will be brought into the formal financial market.
