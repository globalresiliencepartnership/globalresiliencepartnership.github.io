Agro-pastoral communities comprise the majority of the population across the Sahel, a population increasingly at risk to a dangerous confluence of chronic drought, political instability, and seasonal climactic instability. Many households, particularly women-led households, lack basic access to financial services and savings mechanisms that could allow for improved household resilience to shocks. This teamâ€™s key innovation is that, by better understanding the demand for access to micro-credit, insurance and savings mechanisms, as well as cash transfers through social protection schemes, it will be possible to communicate these demands to private sector and public actors. By examining and measuring various financial solutions for resilience in the face of future shocks and stresses, the team can identify key barriers and previously unknown market demands for resilience-building financial services.
