Recent breakthroughs in remote sensing technologies are offering unprecedented opportunities to address those challenges. Microsatellite imagery, environmental sensors, and ICT-based rapid data collection tools are becoming increasingly affordable and accessible to communities and organizations. Yet, while engineers and data scientists have been relatively successful in democratizing these tools, there is still little evidence on the transformative impact of new technologies on community resilience. It is still unclear how, when, and by whom they should be used, and to what extent they should replace traditional data collection techniques. To advance the use and understanding of modern measurement technologies in crisis-prone settings, we need to ground truth different methods in different contexts, and benchmark each technique against each other. We then need develop these technologies as an integral part of existing resilience-building interventions, with a focus on affordability and local relevance.
We will organize two cross-sectorial workshops on innovative measurement technologies for improved resilience, to identify candidate interventions for piloting, and award a series of competitive, targeted seed grants ($20-30K) to support the integration of new tools into actual programs and catalyze their development.

Grant-supported projects will leverage CEGA’s multidisciplinary network of 50 affiliated researchers to ground-truth rapidly scalable, high-impact tools for crisis response and prevention developed by technology partners (through integration in resilience programs from BRAC and The World Bank’s Development Impact Evaluation Initiative (DIME) and Living Standards Measurement Study Group (LSMS). Pilot interventions will be designed at two different workshops, one at BRAC Headquarters in Dhaka, Bangladesh, and one at the World Bank Headquarters in Washington, DC.

The partnership is expected to benefit implementing partners by improving their capacity to monitor risks in near-real time and respond to challenges in a more rapid and informed manner, thereby building resilience to climate, food, and conflict-related challenges in SSEA. It will help technology partners to benchmark their tools across different resilience efforts, generating valuable information for technology development. Projects will also yield rich data on individual behavior in face of adversity, which will be valuable to the research community.
