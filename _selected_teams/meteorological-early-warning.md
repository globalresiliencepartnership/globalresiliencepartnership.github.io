In developed nations, advanced meteorological systems allow for early warning, preparation and long-term monitoring of climate shocks. Costs and technological expertise present major barriers to creating simple early warning systems in the Horn of Africa, allowing heavy rains and flash floods to destroy important crops and disrupt livelihoods.

This team’s key innovation looks at how new technologies – tested first in Uganda - can help deliver an early warning system across the region. By first exploring how early warning information can specifically help prevent weather related damage from occurring in the first place, the team will apply their findings to developing an innovative solution that assists in minimizing damage and adapting to new weather patterns. With agriculture accounting for 26% of Uganda’s GDP, this system has the potential to have wide ranging and lasting impact on the lives of local people, and is something that also has the potential to be scaled across the Horn of Africa.
