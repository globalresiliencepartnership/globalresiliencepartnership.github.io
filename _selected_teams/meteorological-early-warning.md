In developed nations, advanced meteorological systems allow for early warning, preparation and long-term monitoring of climate-shocks. Costs and technological expertise present major barriers to creating simple early-warning systems in the Horn of Africa, allowing heavy rains and flash floods to destroy important crops and disrupt livelihoods.
 
This team’s key innovation looks at how new technologies can help deliver an early-warning system across the region. Their approach considers how this information can help prevent weather related damage occurring in the first place, minimize impact, bounce back from it when it does occur and adapt to new weather patterns. With agriculture accounting for 26% of Uganda’s GDP, this system has the potential to have wide ranging and lasting impact on the lives of local people, and is something that also has the potential to be scaled across the Horn of Africa.
