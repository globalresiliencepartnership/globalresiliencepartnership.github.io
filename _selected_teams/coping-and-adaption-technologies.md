Mahila Housing SEWA Trust will empower women from slums in seven South Asian cities to take action against the most pressing climate-related risks facing their communities: heat waves, flooding, water scarcity; and water and vector borne diseases. Through the improved availability of real-time micro data, the team will equip the urban poor with the tools and know-how to undertake vulnerability and risk assessments and implement their own resilience plans. Utilizing a network of woman advocates, they will empower these communities to influence city planning so that their cities adopt adaptation and resilience actions that reflect a pro-poor agenda.
