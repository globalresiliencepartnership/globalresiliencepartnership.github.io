The South Asia region has been witnessing numerous climate related events in the recent past, leaving the dense urban populations vulnerable to negative impacts of acute water stress, heat extremes, flash flooding, and diseases. For South Asia, this translates to susceptibility of around 190.7 million people living in slums and informal settlements. Currently there exists a wide gap between the knowledge, understanding and skills of technical experts and the affected communities and local governments. 

The team’s main innovation is to bridge barriers between technical experts, slum residents and city officials through community based vulnerability assessments, targeted community leaders training and implementing a range of resilience-building technologies. Specifically, the team aims to create a unique socio-technical partnership between communities and technical experts in 100 slum communities and in seven cities of South Asia. The overall goal is to directly impact the lives of more than 125,000 poor families living in urban slums and indirectly impact as many as 5.75 million people.
