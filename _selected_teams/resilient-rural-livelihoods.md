Food security and malnutrition across the Sahel continue to worsen. Nearly five million more people have joined the ranks of the food insecure since the beginning of 2014, bringing the estimated total to 24.7 million.  Vulnerable groups, like small-scale farming households, barely start to recover from one acute crisis, before being hit by yet another. The overarching goal is to develop a “proof of concept” of an effective collaborative, integrated approach to strengthening resilience of resource-poor farmers living in ecologically fragile and risk-prone dry lands. Central to an effective approach for dry land farmers is to promote an alternative, multi-functional approach to agriculture that will contribute to stable, sustainable, climate resilient food production and livelihoods. This alternative approach to farming, called “agro-ecology,” includes methods such as farmer managed regeneration of trees. 

Despite its importance, agro-ecology still has not become part of mainstream practice in the Sahel. There are many barriers and obstacles preventing its spread. Nor can agro-ecology alone achieve a robust and lasting level of household resilience, particularly for women and children. For this reason, the Groundswell team’s key innovation is being termed “AE+6” (Agro-ecology Plus Six). This entails using agro-ecology as the “foundation” of a resilience approach with communities in the dry land areas, but integrating six innovative components into it. The first three innovations entail “deepening agro-ecology” by testing ways to make its practice more nutrition, gender and equity sensitive.  The fourth innovation is to develop cost effective ways for scaling up agro-ecology outreach linked with national-level advocacy for more supportive policies. The final two innovations are to add highly synergistic and complementary resilience activities to agro-ecology through local government preparedness for shocks and by enabling women’s access to credit, land, and water.
