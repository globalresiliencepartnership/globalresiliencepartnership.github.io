This project seeks to address the inefficient and fragmented value chains by utilizing technology to provide necessary data, tools and information to improve livelihoods, promote value chain inclusion and build resilience for smallholders. It identifies the causes of this as being lack of production data, lack of logistics data, lack of relevant agricultural information, and low financial literacy and inclusion. If successful, the project will ensure empowered smallholder households have access to systems, tools, data, and information that increases value chain efficiency and inclusion, increases their market opportunities, economic growth and poverty reduction, and ensures financial inclusion especially for women and youth.
