University of Sydney, in collaboration with partners in Australia and Southeast Asia, will strengthen the voices of people with disabilities in the region who are disproportionately affected by climate-related disasters, and often overlooked in traditional disaster risk reduction efforts. Taking a multi-action approach, the team will support the generation of knowledge, risk awareness and skills needed to help people with disabilities to gain institutional and social support needed to effectively prepare for hazards and disasters. Through coordinated advocacy, they will also empower people with disabilities to influence governmental resilience strategies and become champions of resilience in their communities.
