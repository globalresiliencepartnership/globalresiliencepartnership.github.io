Over 30 million people across the Horn of Africa depend on pastoralism for their livelihoods, but prolonged and chronic droughts are increasingly disrupting and threatening these livelihoods and the community structures that rely on them. These risks could be managed by converting a livestock herd to cash in the early drought stages when the livestock are still healthy, known as ‘commercial destocking,’ but pastoralists who do not use markets to manage their livelihood risk usually lose most or all of their herds in cycles of shocks. This team’s key innovation is to research, address, and design financial vehicles to overcome existing barriers for pastoralists to use markets to build economic resilience to chronic drought. The diverse team of experienced NGOs, researchers, and local private sector partners will then apply their findings to pilot scalable solutions across the region.
