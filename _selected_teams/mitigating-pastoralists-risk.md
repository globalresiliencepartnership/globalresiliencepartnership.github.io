MercyCorps will be a catalyst for transformation in the livestock market system, increasing resilience for hundreds of thousands of the most vulnerable people in one of the most shock exposed places in the world: the Horn of Africa. The project will help livestock owners manage their assets and livelihood risks while simultaneously increasing their household-level productivity and wealth.  The project aims to benefit 50,000 vulnerable households.
