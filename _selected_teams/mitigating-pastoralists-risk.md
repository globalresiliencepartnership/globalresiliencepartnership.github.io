More than 30 million people across the Horn of Africa depend on pastoralism for their livelihoods, but prolonged and chronic droughts are increasingly disrupting and threatening this way of life and the community structures that rely on it. One effective way to manage these risks is to sell livestock for cash in the early stages of drought when the herd is still healthy. However, many pastoralists aren’t accustomed to harnessing the power of markets to manage their risk, and so usually lose most or all of their herds in cycles of drought. This team’s key innovation is to research, address, and design financial vehicles to empower pastoralists to overcome the barriers that block their use of markets, and help them build economic resilience to the chronic drought they face. The diverse team of experienced NGOs, evidence-driven researchers, and local private sector partners will then apply their findings from the pilot to develop scalable solutions across the region.
