Building resilience depends heavily on the accurate measurement of variables used to identify risks, humanitarian needs, and the impacts of interventions. Recent breakthroughs in remote sensing technologies offer unprecedented opportunities to collect data in an increasingly faster, cheaper, and more accurate manner. Tools such as environmental sensors, microsatellite imagery, and ICT-based data collection platforms are now more accessible and affordable than ever before. This team’s key resilience innovation is to integrate these technologies into existing resilience programs in South and Southeast Asia that rely on older, less effective measurement approaches, bringing together technology developers, NGOs, and academic researchers. Examples of promising applications of these technologies in resilience program include predicting gaps in small farmers’ crop yields through microsatellite data, identifying power outages through smartphones connected to the electrical grid, or monitoring fluctuation of food staple prices in post-disaster environments.
