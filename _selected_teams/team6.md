This project will build on existing social and institutional capacities to adapt, to enable the populations in the target landscapes to become less vulnerable to shocks and stresses. To achieve this, the project will work with existing stakeholder platforms in each landscape to formulate collaborative strategies to  strengthen  resilience,  particularly  for  the  most  vulnerable,  by  scaling  up  and  strategically  inter-linking integrated development innovations that have already been successful at pilot scale. Landscape resilience, in the context of chronic water and food insecurity requires four interrelated aspects: 1) agro-ecological resilience of food production systems; 2) the resilience of the ecosystem underpinning food production (e.g. flow and quality of water resources); 3) livelihood resilience for households and communities; and 4) institutional resilience to respond effectively to shocks and stresses. Through  an  integrated  landscape  approach,  communities  can  address  a  wide  set  of  inherently connected challenges in the field of land, water, energy and biodiversity, with extensive participation and buy-in from the  communities, governments  and private sector in the  intervention areas. Interventions identified as urgent by the main landscape stakeholders, usually directly related to livelihoods, will be prioritized. Restoration of agricultural soils, aquatic resources, rangelands, forests and watersheds crucial for food security all present opportunities to strengthen resilience of target areas.

This project will seek  to  improve  landscape  planning,  governance  and  investment  and  strategically link and scale up existing innovations, both ‘quick wins’ and longer-term investments. Innovations that need multi-sector coordination will be rigorously analyzed with landscape partners, to identify potential synergies and ways of managing tradeoffs among them. The analysis will draw from LPFN Initiative best practices for the design of institutional innovations to scale up and spatially coordinate practices and investments. Strategies to organize and finance investment in existing technical innovations at scale, and investment in innovations needed for landscape governance, will be developed through a series of landscape leader workshops, strategic mapping analyses and key informant interviews. The work involves close communication with major investors and donors working in the landscapes. Elements include landscape assessments; stakeholder engagement, visioning and negotiation on  landscape  strategies  and  priorities;  technical  and  institutional  intervention  design;  collaborative implementation; and the tracking of changes in activities and impacts at landscape scale. The project team will adapt resilience indicators from EcoAgriculture Partners and the Satoyama Initiative.
