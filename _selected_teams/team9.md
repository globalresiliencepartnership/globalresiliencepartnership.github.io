Mahila Housing SEWA Trust (MHT) proposes to create and implement resilience plans to address four major climate risks, heat stress, flash floods, acute water shortages and vector borne diseases, in 100 slum communities in 7 cities of South Asia - Ahmedabad, Jaipur, Bhopal, Ranchi, Bhubaneshwar (India), Kathmandu (Nepal) and Dhaka (Bangladesh). The aim is to tackle information and knowledge barriers in building capacities of slum communities and city governments for assessing vulnerabilities and risks of Climate Change on poor populations. It will address the critical partnership gap between technical experts, local governments and low income communities to undertake participatory risk assessments and design joint technical solutions.

The team believes that if the urban poor are provided with the requisite knowledge to undertake vulnerability and risk assessments and equipped with available resilient-technologies, they will be able to devise and implement locally relevant and pro-poor climate resilient solutions. If the poor are empowered to implement their own resilience plans, they will be able to better influence climate resilient city planning and ensure that effective urban adaptation practices are in place. MHT would thus create a unique socio-technical partnership between communities and technical experts as a part of the Global Resilience Partnership challenge. The team will devise a multi-layered solutions approach, including households' and community based adaptation strategies as well as infrastructure, institutional and financial mechanisms. It will use a) Cross Consultations and partnership building between slum communities, technical experts and local governments for Joint Risk Identification and Analysis; b) Developing evidence-based holistic Action Plans by empowering slum communities and c) Dissemination.

The project would create replicable models in close collaboration with the city governments and build city level slum dwellers forums for negotiating for their rights. It is expected to directly impact the lives of more than 125,000 poor families living in urban slums in the 7 cities by creating their capacities to deal with climate risks and vulnerability or further have an indirect impact on more than 5.75 million slum dwellers in these 7 cities of South Asia.
