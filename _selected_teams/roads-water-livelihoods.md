MetaMeta Research and partners will transform the way roads – conduits for modern commerce and life – are planned and built in the Horn of Africa by introducing innovative designs and improved guidelines to harvest rainwater, prevent soil erosion, and improve use of roadside land. By bringing together government authorities, water and climate experts, and roadside communities – especially women and the poor, this team will ensure that road construction efforts produce multiple benefits for all communities and enhance resilience.
