As chronic droughts and flash flooding increase in severity across the Horn of Africa, cost-effective water management solutions are sorely needed. The explosion of rural road infrastructure construction, particularly highways and feeder roads, often contributes to the problem by dramatically changing water flow patterns. 

This teamâ€™s key innovation lies in harnessing the positive opportunity that roads present to systematically harvest and retain water, prevent erosion, and contribute to irrigation systems. With annual direct investments to improve road infrastructure in the Horn of Africa of close to $4 billion, this team would bring together major stakeholders in the infrastructure and disaster reduction fields to educate officials and leverage road-building for resilience-building purposes. The best practices for training and education that will be developed would be translated and offered for use in other countries to help integrate road-water-climate governance.
