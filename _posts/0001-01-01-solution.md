## With an initial commitment of $100 million from the [Rockefeller Foundation](http://www.rockefellerfoundation.org/) and [USAID](http://www.usaid.gov/), the Global Resilience Partnership is building systemic approaches to addressing climate and population change.

- Together we will
- Identify critical capacity gaps
- Catalyze alliances across all sectors
- Enable regional and global learning
- Advance data-driven analytics and measurements
- Design flexible financial mechanisms, such as micro-finance and risk insurance

##  We will strive to improve resilience at multiple scales: from families to communities, countries to regions.
