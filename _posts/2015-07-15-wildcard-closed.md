title: 'WILD CARD' ELEMENT OF GLOBAL RESLIENCE CHALLENGE NOW CLOSED!
---

We have now closed the "Wild Card" Challenge. The selected teams will join the 17 teams selected in Stage One and will also be eligible to implement the high-impact solutions with a focus on finance, technology or both. The selected ideas will have elements that are targeted at building resilience in three focus areas, that is, the Horn of Africa, the Sahel, and South and Southeast Asia.

We look forward to announcing the winning teams in September, who will receive up to $1 million to implement and scale up their solutions in their regions.
