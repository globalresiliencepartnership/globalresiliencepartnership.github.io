Thank you to everyone who participated in the Global Resilience Challenge. The first round of the Challenge closed on November 30, and nearly 500 applications were submitted – a testament to the great interest in and need for building resilience in the Resilience Partnership’s focus regions of the Sahel, the Horn of Africa, and South and Southeast Asia. Teams will be informed by February 6, 2015 if they have been selected to move to Stage Two and develop Problem Statements.
