<p class="main">GPR wants to create a network that works on various levels: global,  regional, and local. GPR, at the global level, mobilizes regional  collaborations. Each partner hosts a region-wide ecosystem of diverse  local actors, and supports collaboration between various actors.

  <h5>Local</h5>
	<p class="captions">Global resiliency efforts will be most effective if there is cross-sector collaboration. To this end, GPR will motivate local and regional institutions, the private sector,  development agencies, humanitarian organizations -- all of whom have  vastly diverse strengths in their arsenal.</p>
