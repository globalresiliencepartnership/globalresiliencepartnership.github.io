title: World Humanitarian Summit&#58; GRP bolsters resilience portfolio - announcing its engagement with two new support networks
---
The Global Resilience Partnership (GRP) announced its engagement with two new support networks to strengthen its resilience portfolio.

The Global Resilience Partnership, which aims to help millions of vulnerable people across the globe prepare for unexpected shocks and adapt to chronic stresses so they can thrive in a more secure future, will  engage with both the <a href="http://www.near.ngo/" target="_blank">Network of Empowered Aid Response (NEAR)</a> and the <a href="https://consultations.worldhumanitariansummit.org/bitcache/6bc3e09ca9b3962daf885630fbe3b20a3abb369f?vid=579146&disposition=inline&op=view" target="_blank">Global Alliance for Urban Crises</a> to improve resilience in the Sahel, the Horn of Africa and south and southeast Asia.

Collaboration is at the heart of the Global Resilience Partnership’s ambition to catalyse change and encourage development in new and innovative ways. Listening to and involving a wider range of voices will strengthen its network, empower some of the world’s most at risk communities and help to achieve lasting impacts at scale.

NEAR aims to close the gap between the traditional aid system and the communities it aims to serve. It puts people at the heart of every humanitarian and development response so that donors at one end and affected communities at the other can see the quantity and quality of what is delivered and received.  

Global Alliance for Urban Crises will deliver a cohesive and strategic approach to humanitarian crises in urban settings and emerged as a response to the growing need associated with rapid urbanization, working with a coalition of partners to do so.   

The announcement comes during the first World Humanitarian Summit, which sees political leaders from across the globe converge in Istanbul for two days of discussion and debate on how humanity —people’s safety, dignity and the right to thrive — can be placed at the heart of global decision-making, to improve the global humanitarian system.

Dr Luca Alinovi, executive director of the Global Resilience Partnership, said: “We are committed to looking at how development and aid are delivered, thought about and measured. Engaging with these two networks allows the GRP to share ideas and approaches and provide a catalyst for radical change in the way we assist some of the world’s most vulnerable communities. 

"We need a critical mass of organisations working together to affect change. Both initiatives deliver a cohesive and strategic approach to humanitarian crises and are responsive and flexible enough to stay nimble to changing demands. Through doing so we can close the gap between the traditional aid system and the communities it aims to serve and bring about faster, more targeted change.

"We remain committed to looking at the world’s big, seemingly unsolvable issues. Engaging with these two organisations will further enhance our ability to build resilience where it is most needed."
