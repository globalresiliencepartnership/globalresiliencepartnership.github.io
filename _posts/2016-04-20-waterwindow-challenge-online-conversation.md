Floods are one of the main disaster risks globally. Recognizing that only the most inventive ideas will effectively tackle this issue, the <a href="http://www.globalresiliencepartnership.org/" target="_blank" class="blue">Global Resilience Partnership</a> has launched the <a href="http://waterwindow.globalresiliencepartnership.org/" target="_blank" class="blue">Global Resilience Challenge Water Window</a>. The challenge is a joint association between <a href="https://www.zurich.com/" target="_blank" class="blue">Zurich Insurance Group</a> and the Resilience Partnership. It offers up to US$1 million in grants for teams developing innovative solutions to issues affecting flood prone communities across the Sahel, the Horn of Africa, and South and Southeast Asia.

In tandem, Devex is hosting an online conversation to explore how development actors can empower communities at risk to prepare for, adapt to, and thrive in the face of disasters like flooding, drought, food insecurity, conflict and more. Over the next six months, tune in for articles and analysis, guest commentary, video interviews, and online events.
