We are delighted to welcome our new Senior Policy Adviser and Policy Lead, David Howlett, to the GRP team. David is seconded from the United Kingdom’s Department for International Development (DFID). He has over thirty 35 years’ experience in development in Africa, Asia and the Pacific with an academic background in chemistry, soil sciences, agriculture and environmental management and has published widely.

David has worked for the last 14 years for DFID on different policy and research roles. He designed and commissioned DFID’s Building Resilience and Adaptation to Climate Extreme Disasters (BRACED) programme which has many synergies with the work of GRP. He managed DFID’s support to IFAD’s Adaptation for Smallholder Agriculture Programme (ASAP) and led on climate smart agriculture for DFID and UK Government, and co-convened the Investment Action Group of the Global Alliance for Climate Smart Agriculture.
David’s extensive experience on policy and development will be invaluable in his new role as GRP’s Senior Policy Adviser where he will head GRP’s programme and work on Policy and Influence. David will be based in the UK with regular visits to Nairobi, and other project locations.
