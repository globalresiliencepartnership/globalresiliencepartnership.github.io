# Global Resilience Challenge

## An essential feature of the Resilience Partnership is a multi-phase resilience design challenge, focused on bringing together people and organizations from across sectors to collaborate on bold and innovative solutions to the toughest resilience challenges in the three focus regions: the Horn of Africa, the Sahel, and South and Southeast Asia. Multi-sectoral teams will collectively research and diagnose problems, and develop locally driven, high-impact solutions that can build resilience at scale.

The first round of the Challenge closed on November 30, and nearly 500 applications were submitted – a testament to the great interest in and need for building resilience in the Resilience Partnership’s focus regions of the Sahel, the Horn of Africa, and South and Southeast Asia. Teams will be informed by February 9, 2015 if they have been selected to move to Stage Two and develop Problem Statements.</li>
