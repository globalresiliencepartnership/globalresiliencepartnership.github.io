## With an initial commitment of $100 million from [the Rockefeller Foundation]() and [USAID](), we are forming the Global Resilience Partnership, to improve resilience at multiple scales: from families to communities, countries to regions.

- We aim to
- Identify critical capacity gaps
- Catalyze alliances across all sectors
- Enable regional and global learning
- Advance data-driven analytics and measurements
- Design flexible financial mechanisms, such as micro-finance and risk insurance
