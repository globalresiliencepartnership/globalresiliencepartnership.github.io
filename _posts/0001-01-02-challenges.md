<p class="main">Since 1990, natural disasters have affected about 217 million people every year. 
There were three times as many natural disasters between 2000 to 2009 compared to the amount between 1980 and 1989. 80% of this growth is due to climate-related events. Over the last 30 years, one out of three dollars spent on development was lost as a result of recurrent crises

<br><br>It is becoming increasingly difficult to prepare for, respond to, and recover from such global catastrophes. Rockefeller Foundation and USAID are jointly launching a $100 million initiative that aims to build resilience around chronic shocks and stresses in some of the hardest hit regions.</p>

In Asia, over 400 million people are expected to be vulnerable to flooding by 2025.</p>

  	<h5>The Sahel</h5>
	<p class="captions">For much of the 1970s and 1980s, the region suffered repeated and devastating droughts, crop failures, and an encroaching desert, all of  which caused much suffering. The impact of this ecological crisis has steadily deepened, making economic and social fabric weak as well. In 2011 and 2012, the US Government spent $1.5 billion in the Horn and the Sahel</p>
