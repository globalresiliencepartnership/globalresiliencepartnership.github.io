The Global Resilience Partnership today announced 17 teams selected to move forward in the Global Resilience Challenge. Teams were chosen from among nearly 500 applicants across six continents. In applying for the Global Resilience Challenge, teams were asked to submit their vision and plan for taking a multi-disciplinary and multi-sectoral approach to solving the greatest resilience challenges across the Sahel, the Horn of Africa and South and Southeast Asia. 

The selected resilience topics, teams, and team leaders, designated by focus region are:

**Sahel**  

* “Agroecology, Climate Change Adaptation, nutrition,” Peter Gubbels,  Groundswell International 
* “Enhanced social and economic capital,” Julie Snorek, Mercy Corps 

**Horn of Africa**  

* “Integrated Landscape Management,” Araya Asfaw, Horn of Africa Regional Environment Centre & Network 
* “Livestock trade,” Tate Munro, Mercy Corps  
* “Road Water Harvesting,” Frank Van Steenbergen, MetaMeta Research  
* “Tracking and measuring resilience,” Lindsey Jones, Overseas Development Institute 
* “Resilience against severe weather,” Nick van de Giesen, Stichting TAHMO 

**South and Southeast Asia**  

* “Applying risk information to community resilience,” Robert Laprade, The American Red Cross 
* “Risk assessment, measurement and collaboration,” Manisha Bhinge, RAC USA 
* “Disaster Risk Reduction and Climate Resilience,” Josh Woodard, FHI 360 
* “Environmental & Economic Resilience,” Christina Chao, The Grameen Foundation  
* “Climate Change,” Stephanie Rust, Institute for Sustainable Communities 
* “Wetlands, Ramsar, and Mekong river,” Robert Mather, International Union for Conversation of Nature 
* “Climate Change and Urban Slum Dwellers,” Renana Jahbwala, Mahila Housing SEWA Trust 
* “Community adaptation, flood early warning,” J. Craig Jenkins, Mershon Center for International Security Studies, Ohio State University 
* “Coastal Communities Resilience,” Michael Beck, The Nature Conservancy  
* “Disaster Risk Reduction,” Emma Calgaro, University of Sydney


“The diversity and ambitions of the hundreds of teams that applied is another testament to the incredible momentum and interest in building resilience,” said Dr. Judith Rodin, President of The Rockefeller Foundation.  “The teams named today have bold and innovative ideas for getting ahead of the next crisis in a way that will make millions of lives better day-to-day, so that they and their communities realize a resilience dividend – investments that yield positive economic and social impacts every day particularly for poor and vulnerable people, and that can prevent disruptions from becoming disasters.”  

The Global Resilience Challenge is a three-stage grant competition led by the Global Resilience Partnership, a $150 million effort of The Rockefeller Foundation, United States Agency for International Development (USAID), and the Swedish International Development Cooperation Agency (Sida) to help the global community pivot from being reactive in the wake of disasters to driving evidence-based investments to better manage and adapt to inevitable shocks. Teams moving forward in the Challenge comprise scientists, policy practitioners, humanitarians, and a host of experts from across dozens of other disciplines. With up to $200,000 in next stage funding, these 17 teams will explore the effects of persistent cycles of drought, storms, famine, and other disasters on vulnerable populations in each of the focus regions, and identify locally driven, scalable solutions that can help communities and households adapt to and recover from chronic shocks and stresses, while reducing vulnerabilities.

“Harnessing the power of public-private partnership, the Global Resilience Challenge represents our new model of development,” said USAID Administrator Dr. Rajiv Shah.  “We are excited by the potential of this next stage in the Challenge to unlock bold and scalable solutions that build resilience and put millions on a pathway out of extreme poverty.”

The teams proceeding to Stage Two of the competition will further develop their problem statements, examining the root causes of the challenges present in their regions and propose solutions and implementation plans for their concepts. In Stage Three, the best plans will be funded with up to $1 million to implement and scale up these solutions in each region.  

“We look forward to seeing the creative and scalable solutions developed through the collaboration among all sectors—from governments, the private sector, academia and civil society,” said Anders Granlund, Lead Policy Specialist, Environment and Climate at the Swedish International Development Cooperation Agency.
