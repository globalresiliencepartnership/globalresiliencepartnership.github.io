Women and girls are at great risk in areas of crisis, where 60 percent of maternal mortality occurs. So how can we scale up reproductive efforts to victims of natural or man-made disasters, including flooding and conflict?

In an exclusive Devex interview, Dr. Babatunde Osotimehim, undersecretary-general of the United Nations and executive director of the U.N. Population Fund, talks with global development reporter Helen Morgan about the importance of working with countries and communities to increase resilience.

“The resources we have should not be siloed to look after just development — we need to ensure that as we build for development, we also build for resilience,” he said, adding that more can be done to help prevent flooding in areas prone to natural disaster.

Watch the clip above to learn more from Osotimehin about the need to ensure women and girls have secure livelihoods, are able to access family planning, and are able to engage in infrastructure building.
